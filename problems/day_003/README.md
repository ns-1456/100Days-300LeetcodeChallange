# Day 003

## Topic: Stack & Monotonic Stack

## Problems Solved:
- ✅ **155. Min Stack** - Implemented a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time
- ✅ **739. Daily Temperatures** - Solved using monotonic stack to find the next warmer day for each element
- ✅ **853. Car Fleet** - Implemented using sorting and monotonic stack approach to count car fleets

## Learning Outcomes:
- Mastered the Min Stack pattern with auxiliary data structures
- Applied monotonic stack to solve next greater element type problems
- Used sorting combined with stack techniques for complex problems

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
